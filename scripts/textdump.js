    "Have you ever felt like something was off?",
    "Have you ever felt as if you're not truly awake?",
    "It's that emptiness you feel as you walk from place to place.",
    "As if none of it matters.",
    "As if it's all just a dream.",
    "A feeling that never goes away.",
    "It follows you everywhere you go.",
    "It never lets go.",
    "Sometimes, you forget it.",
    "Not because it's gone, you're just used to it.",
    "The same way you're used to your heart beating.",
    "To your own breathing, your own movements.",
    "But when you notice, it grips you so tightly.",
    "It reminds you that you will never escape it.",
    "That slowly, but surely, every part of you will fall to it.",
    "And over time, things just seem to get stranger and stranger.",
    "Like everything is crumbling around you.",
    "It's only a matter of time.",
    "The numbness spreads.",
    "And it never stops.",
    "Maybe I'm trying to give meaning to something meaningless.",
    "Maybe I want to feel like it's not all for nothing.",
    "That there is a reason behind this.",
    "That there is something I have to do with my burden.",
    "Or perhaps I'm hoping I'm not alone.",
    "By thinking about all of this, by hearing my own words...",
    "They start to feel familiar.",
    "It feels so casual now.",
    "And I often wonder if everyone thinks like this.",
    "Well, I wouldn't know.",
    "It's not like I've asked anyone.",
    "How would you even begin discussing this?",
    "What would you say?",
    "Besides, who would you ask?",
    "Noone seems to feel the way I do.",
    "I can't find any common ground to stand on.",
    "About these dreams, these nightmares, or this awful feeling.",
    "It feels hopeless.",
    "My way of experiencing this world, my thoughts, or my feelings.",
    "None of these will ever be brought to light.",
    "Nobody will ever know what it's like to be me.",
    "I will continue to suffer, and then, I'll die.",
    "I will disappear the same way I was brought here.",
    "Without a sound, not a single cry.",
    "And I can't complain about it.",
    "Even though I so desperately crave another way, I can't.",
    "How selfish would it be to ask for others to remember you?",
    "What have I done to be remembered for?",
    "What have I ever done to deserve to be mourned?",
    "Was I really good to people?",
    "I can't remember stumbling upon any successes on my way here.",
    "Am I being negative?",
    "Of course I am.",
    "But how could I not be?",
    "I wake up every day unsure of whether or not I truly did wake up.",
    '"I think, therefore I am."',
    "I mean, I do a lot of thinking, for sure.",
    "But am I?",
    "I don't even have the luxury of feeling alive.",
    "Hell, I feel a stronger sense of being in my nightmares.",
    "Being surrounded by faceless monsters feels better than breathing this air.",
    "My body doesn't feel like it belongs to me anymore.",
    "Has it ever?",
    "Is this normal?",
    "And yet again, I come back to this question.",
    "The answer is so simple, though.",
    '"I will never know."',
    "I know that.",
    "I know that well.",
    "I know it way too well.",
    "I know it way, way, way too well.",
    "So why can't I stop asking this question?",
    "Am I hoping the answer will change?",
    "I've come to a point where I wish I could go insane.",
    "I don't want to face reality anymore.",
    "It's been this way for years, now.",
    "I wish I could rely on something, anything.",
    "Something like faith, something like promises, or white lies.",
    "But I can't help it.",
    "Faith isn't something you choose.",
    "I can't change reality, and I can't change myself either.",
    "I wish someone could tell me these two words:",
    '"I understand."',
    "I want others to understand me and I want to understand them too.",
    "I want it more than anything else.",
    "I want to speak, I want to say something, and be understood.",
    "I want to find someone like me.",
    "I need it.",
    "But it won't happen, will it?",
    "You don't just hope things into existence.",
    "You have to work for them.",
    "Yeah, work for them, sure.",
    "How do you work for that?",
    "I should just stop.",
    "I need to stop thinking.",
    "It feels horrible.",
    "Like opening my eyes to stare directly into the sun.",
    "Why bother?",
    "I can't.",
    "You can't be someone else.",
    "You can only ever be yourself.",
    "It's just how it is.",
    "It's cruel, but it's just how it is.",
    "It's depressing, but it's just how it is.",
    "Isn't it?"
